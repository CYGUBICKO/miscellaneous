# Problem

In many data collection software, multiple response questions' selections (respondent can choose more than one option) are usually stored in a single cell separated with some characters. This problem is mostly common in _ODK_ and other _ODK_ based tools. In addition, a more general problem could be creating columns from a single column of a dataframe based on some pattern.

# Possible solution(s) approaches

* Split columns in excel

* Use R functions

In this document, we will show a step by step guide on how to write a R function which will be able to do the job.
